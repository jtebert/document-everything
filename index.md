{{ site.description }}

I like programming, 3D printing, and robots, so most of what you find here is related to that.

## About

This is rough contemporaneous documentation of projects I'm working on. Its main purpose is to be reference for myself in case I find myself doing something similar in the future. It's based on the concept of documentation I learned in [How To Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/people/julia-ebert/):
- It should be honest about your process, your mistakes & failures, and be done *while* you work (not after), so you don't sugar coat it and leave out the interesting/important details.
- You're way less likely to actually write stuff down if you wait until you've already finished the project.
- Explaining things by writing them down helps you solve your own problems (like [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)).
- It helps you keep track of useful resources/links as you're going, so you don't need to keep open 300 browser tabs.
- Something is better than nothing: focus on writing down *something* about what you're doing, rather than trying to write the perfect thing, and ending up writing *nothing*. That also means incomplete documentation is still better than no documentation.
- Everyone loves lots of pictures.
