## "Oops, all nuts!" pencil organizer

![Pencil cup that looks like a stack of giant nuts](/assets/img/3d-printing/oops-all-nuts.jpg)
{:.left}

It's like my nut & bolt pencil holder, but this time it's all nuts. It also has compatible M80 threads.

## Nozzle box

![Open nozzle box](/assets/img/3d-printing/nozzle-box.jpg)
{:.left}

The multi-color, labeled nozzle box uses the same print-in-place hinges and latch that I created for my pill boxes.

And it [won the Printables contest](https://www.printables.com/contest/61-nozzle-holders#winners) for nozzle holders!

## Diamine ink bottle holder

![Ink bottle in holder](/assets/img/3d-printing/diamine-ink-holder.jpg)

I spilled most of a bottle of ink. I'm not doing that again.

## Compact case for DeWalt 1/4" socket set

![Socket box](/assets/img/3d-printing/socket-box.jpg)
{:.left}

This socket set is great, but it came with a ridiculously huge case. This fits everything in half the size, and includes print-in-place labels.

## Offline dinosaur game magnets

Chrome lets you play a game when you have no internet. I've taken that game and made it available on your refrigerator (or any other ferromagnetic surface).

## Mega Lego seleton

![Mega Lego Skeleton](/assets/img/projects/lego-skeleton/complete-skeleton.jpg)
{:.left}

10:1 scale Lego skeleton, printed in 25 separate parts, plus 50 connector pins. All the functionality of your favorite childhood toy, but now 40 cm tall.

## Flexi-gator

![Flexi-gator](/assets/img/3d-printing/flexi-gator.jpg)
{:.left}

It's a flexible alligator, inspired by Flexi Rex, but more *Florida.* It's the first time I've made a design based on something biological. This is currently my peak accomplishment in 3D printed toy design.

## "My First Pandemic" 2020 ornament

![First Pandemic Ornament](/assets/img/3d-printing/first-pandemic-ornament.jpg)
{:.left}

You might have a "My First Christmas" ornament. Now you can add "My First Pandemic" to your collection of 2020 commemorative ornaments. It's a fast, easy, multi-color print designed completely from scratch.

**Models:** [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/48723), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4683445)

## Larger weekly pill box

![Pill box](/assets/img/3d-printing/larger-pillbox.jpg)
{:.left}

It's like the compact pill box, but less compact.

**Models:** [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/48132), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4675070)

## Multi-color 2020 dumpster fire ornament

![2020 Dumpster Fire](/assets/img/3d-printing/2020-dumpster-fire.jpg)
{:.left}

A summary of 2020, in 3D printed form.

There are a lot of similar designs out there, but mine has wheels! And colored text. And everything is designed with overhangs and tolerances that make it very easy to print.

(There's also a [2021 version](https://www.printables.com/model/51174).)

## Nut & bolt pencil organizer

![Pencil holder](/assets/img/3d-printing/pencil-holder.jpg)
{:.left}

It's a pencil holder that's also a functional M80 nut and bolt. There are others like this online, but they weren't quite the right size, so I made my own.

**Models:** [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/44623), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4638012)

## Compact weekly pill box

![Pill box](/assets/img/3d-printing/pillbox.jpg)
{:.left}

I didn't like any of the pill boxes you could buy, so I made my own. I wanted something that's compact, reliable, and looks cool.

## ErgoDox Infinity built-in wrist rest

![Ergodox case extension](/assets/img/3d-printing/ergodox-extension.jpg)
{:.left}

This modification to the Ergodox Infinity makes it cheap to build in a wrist rest/full hand extension for additional comfort. It's non-destructive to the original case, so it's easy to swap in and out.

**Models:** [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/19496), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4133944)

## Robot attack safety sign

![sign](/assets/img/3d-printing/tag-sign.jpg)
{:.left}

Put safety first with this tag sign to remind you how long it has been since your research facility's last robot uprising.

## 75% ortholinear keyboard

![keyboard](/assets/img/projects/keyboard/assembly-complete.jpg)
{:.left}

Are you envious of all those custom [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), but have way less money than time? Like me, you could sink your time into 3D printing a mechanical keyboard, from case to keycaps.

## Benchy wall mount

![Benchy wall mount](/assets/img/3d-printing/benchy-mount.jpg)
{:.left}

Every time we get a new filament in the lab, I print the small boat and use this to hang it on the wall. It's one of the first things you see when you walk into the office. As it should be.
