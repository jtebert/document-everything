This is a subset of the things I've designed, in approximately reverse-chronological order.

## Nut & bolt pencil organizer

It's a pencil holder that's also a functional M80 nut and bolt. There are others like this online, but they weren't quite the right size, so I made my own.

## Compact weekly pill box

I didn't like any of the pill boxes you could buy, so I made my own. I wanted something that's compact, reliable, and looks cool.

## ErgoDox Infinity built-in wrist rest

This modification to the Ergodox Infinity makes it cheap to build in a wrist rest/full hand extension for additional comfort. It's non-destructive to the original case, so it's easy to swap in and out.

## Robot attack safety sign

Put safety first with this tag sign to remind you how long it has been since your research facility's last robot uprising.

## 75% ortholinear keyboard

Are you envious of all those custom [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), but have way less money than time? Like me, you could sink your time into 3D printing a mechanical keyboard, from case to keycaps.

## Benchy wall mount

Every time we get a new filament in the lab, I print the small boat and use this to hang it on the wall. It's one of the first things you see when you walk into the office. As it should be.
