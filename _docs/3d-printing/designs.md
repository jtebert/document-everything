This is a subset of the things I've designed, in approximately reverse-chronological order.

*Coming soon:*

- Flexi gator (currently my peak accomplishment in 3D printed toy designs)
- MMU-compatiable heatbed mount for [this camera mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3114849/files)
- Tool holder for Prusa MK3/S/+ (remixed from [Tool Rail for Prusa i3 MK3](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/46474))
- Printer nozzle box (based on the same box design as my pill boxes)

## "My First Pandemic" 2020 Ornament

You might have a "My First Christmas" ornament. Now you can add "My First Pandemic" to your collection of 2020 commemorative ornaments. It's a fast, easy, multi-color print designed completely from scratch.

## Larger weekly pill box

It's like the compact pill box, but less compact.

## Multi-color 2020 Dumpster Fire Ornament

A summary of 2020, in 3D printed form.

There are a lot of similar designs out there, but mine has wheels! And colored text. And everything is designed with overhangs and tolerances that make it very easy to print.

## Nut & bolt pencil organizer

![Pencil holder](/assets/img/3d-printing/pencil-holder.jpg)

It's a pencil holder that's also a functional M80 nut and bolt. There are others like this online, but they weren't quite the right size, so I made my own.

## Compact weekly pill box

![Pill box](/assets/img/3d-printing/pillbox.jpg)
{:.left}

I didn't like any of the pill boxes you could buy, so I made my own. I wanted something that's compact, reliable, and looks cool.

## ErgoDox Infinity built-in wrist rest

![Ergodox case extension](/assets/img/3d-printing/ergodox-extension.jpg)

This modification to the Ergodox Infinity makes it cheap to build in a wrist rest/full hand extension for additional comfort. It's non-destructive to the original case, so it's easy to swap in and out.

## Robot attack safety sign

Put safety first with this tag sign to remind you how long it has been since your research facility's last robot uprising.

## 75% ortholinear keyboard

Are you envious of all those custom [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), but have way less money than time? Like me, you could sink your time into 3D printing a mechanical keyboard, from case to keycaps.

## Benchy wall mount

![Benchy wall mount](/assets/img/3d-printing/benchy-mount.jpg)

Every time we get a new filament in the lab, I print the small boat and use this to hang it on the wall. It's one of the first things you see when you walk into the office. As it should be.
