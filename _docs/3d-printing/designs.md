This is a subset of the things I've designed, in approximately reverse-chronological order.

*Coming soon:*

- My own brain
- Fully 3D printed Ergodox Infinity case... with magnets!
- MMU-compatible heatbed mount for [this camera mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3114849/files)
- Tool holder for Prusa MK3/S/+ (remixed from [Tool Rail for Prusa i3 MK3](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/46474))

- SD card box (again, with the same box design)
- Improved Ikea Sk√•dis accessories (remixed from [IKEA SKADIS Collection](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853261))
- Stackable Lego-like filament test bricks (with lots of parameters!)
- Yet another minimalist toothbrush holder
- Over-engineered socket set box
- Diamine ink bottle holder

## Offline Dinosaur Game Magnets

Chrome lets you play a game when you have no internet. I've taken that game and made it available on your refrigerator (or any other ferromagnetic surface).

## Mega Lego Skeleton

## Flexi-gator

![Flexi-gator](/assets/img/3d-printing/flexi-gator.jpg)
{:.left}

It's a flexible alligator, inspired by Flexi Rex, but more *Florida.* It's the first time I've made a design based on something biological. This is currently my peak accomplishment in 3D printed toy design.

## "My First Pandemic" 2020 Ornament

![First Pandemic Ornament](/assets/img/3d-printing/first-pandemic-ornament.jpg)
{:.left}

You might have a "My First Christmas" ornament. Now you can add "My First Pandemic" to your collection of 2020 commemorative ornaments. It's a fast, easy, multi-color print designed completely from scratch.

## Larger weekly pill box

![Pill box](/assets/img/3d-printing/larger-pillbox.jpg)

It's like the compact pill box, but less compact.

## Multi-color 2020 Dumpster Fire Ornament

{:.left}

A summary of 2020, in 3D printed form.

There are a lot of similar designs out there, but mine has wheels! And colored text. And everything is designed with overhangs and tolerances that make it very easy to print.

## Nut & bolt pencil organizer

![Pencil holder](/assets/img/3d-printing/pencil-holder.jpg)
{:.left}

It's a pencil holder that's also a functional M80 nut and bolt. There are others like this online, but they weren't quite the right size, so I made my own.

**Models:** [Prusa Printers](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/44623-nut-bolt-pencil-organizer), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4638012)

## Compact weekly pill box

![Pill box](/assets/img/3d-printing/pillbox.jpg)
{:.left}

I didn't like any of the pill boxes you could buy, so I made my own. I wanted something that's compact, reliable, and looks cool.

## ErgoDox Infinity built-in wrist rest

![Ergodox case extension](/assets/img/3d-printing/ergodox-extension.jpg)
{:.left}

This modification to the Ergodox Infinity makes it cheap to build in a wrist rest/full hand extension for additional comfort. It's non-destructive to the original case, so it's easy to swap in and out.

## Robot attack safety sign

{:.left}

Put safety first with this tag sign to remind you how long it has been since your research facility's last robot uprising.

## 75% ortholinear keyboard

![keyboard](/assets/img/projects/keyboard/assembly-complete.jpg)
{:.left}

Are you envious of all those custom [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), but have way less money than time? Like me, you could sink your time into 3D printing a mechanical keyboard, from case to keycaps.

## Benchy wall mount

![Benchy wall mount](/assets/img/3d-printing/benchy-mount.jpg)
{:.left}

Every time we get a new filament in the lab, I print the small boat and use this to hang it on the wall. It's one of the first things you see when you walk into the office. As it should be.
