*Coming soon, when I actually get something done.*

For now, see the [LARVAbot code](https://github.com/jtebert/larvabot) and [LARVAbot PCB](https://github.com/jtebert/larvabot-pcb) repositories.

## Arduino Setup

The current (in progress) version of the LARVAbot code is an Arduino library. Because the LARVAbot board is not a full Arduino board, there are some additional steps required to be able to program it from the Arduino IDE.

1. Install support for programming the raw microcontroller
   - In the Arduino IDE, open Preferences (`File > Preferences` in Linux, at least), and under "Additional Boards Manager URLs" add:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosefr/atmega/master/package_carlosefr_atmega_index.json`
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager` and search `Barebones ATmega Chips` and install. The `Tools > Board` section should now include `ATmega Microcontrollers`.
2. Set up configuration for LARVAbot board. In the `Tools` menu, set the following:
   - Board: ATmega328/328p
   - Processor: ATmega328p
   - Clock: External 20MHz
   - Programmer: USBtinyISP (if you're using the FabISP or my design)
3. Burn the Arduino bootloader (this only needs to be done once for each robot)
   - Connect the robot via the ISP header pins
   - Make sure the right port is selected under `Tools > Port`
   - From the `Tools` menu, select `Burn Bootloader`
4. Install dependencies from `Tools > Manage Libraries...` by searching for the following:
   - [LIDAR library](https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino): VL53L0X
   - SparkFun MPU-9250 9 DOF IMU Breakout
5. Install LARVAbot library to use with your own code Arduino makes you do this by having the file in its libraries directory. You can clone the code repository directly into this location, but I prefer keeping the LARVAbot library code with the rest of the code.
   - Clone the LARVAbot library wherever you want: `git clone git@github.com:jtebert/larvabot.git`
   - Create a symlink to that in the Arduino libraries directory. (Recommend using the full path for the source here)
     ```shell
     ln -s [REPO_LOCATION]/Larva ~/Arduino/libraries
     ```
