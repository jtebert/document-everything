These are things I want to learn how to do or try out. Not for work or anything. Mostly to procrastinate on work. Like everything on this website. And this website itself.

---

## To Learn

- Docker containers
- Different approaches to externally accessing and controlling my 3D printer ([I set up a VPN on my router](/projects/power-pi#vpn))
  - OctoPrint Anywhere
  - AstroPrint
  - Polar Cloud
  - The Spaghetti Detective
  - Port forwarding (seemingly the riskiest)

## To Do

- Start a blog (OK, [I've already actually *created* a blog](https://blog.juliaebert.com), but I need to actually start writing things on it)
  Alternatively: Does this website count?
- Try out Powerlevel10k for ZSH
- [Try using Google Drive as remote network drive](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/08/use-google-drive-ubuntu-16-04-linux-desktops)
- Change the display of the ErgoDox Infinity LCD screen. ([See here for current state of adventures](/projects/infinity-ergodox))

## To Make

- [8" 3D-printed moon lamp](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3242080) (gotta figure out how I'm lighting it up. Section of a 12 V LED strip?)
- Curling stone magnets
- [Bust of Caesar pencil holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2536988)
