## Graphics & Illustrations

- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations): A big collection of color-customizable SVG illustrations (many related to tech/design), and the source of all the header images for this website
- [Scale by Flexiple](https://2.flexiple.com/scale/all-illustrations): Daily color-customizable SVG illustrations. Similar to unDraw, but smaller collection (so far) and more detailed style.
- [manypixels](https://gallery.manypixels.co/): Large collection of stylistically consistent, color-customizable illustrations. This has *multiple* styles, usually with the same illustration available in most/all styles.
- [Lukaszadam](https://lukaszadam.com/illustrations): Small but growing collection of small illustrations
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-art/): Many styles of illustrations of a variety of subjects. (More visually interesting than the trendy flat styles of the above ones)
- [3D Bay](https://clouddevs.com/3dbay/): A collection of high-quality, royalty-free 3D stock images.

## Icons

- [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/): Huge collection of single-color icons, free with attribution.

- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/): Mixture of free (with attribution) and paid icons, in both full- and single-color.

## Patterns & Textures

- [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/): Repeating 2-color SVG patterns for websites. It's what I use on [my website](https://juliaebert.com).
- [Trianglify](https://trianglify.io/): Generate multi-colored triangle-based SVG images
- [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/): Customizable (any colors, multiple patterns) SVG pattern generator. Free with attribution.

- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/): ...More CC0 images. (Sensing a theme here?)

- [Dreamy Pixel](http://dreamypixel.com/gallery-of-free-photograhs-images/): Some free images, which I haven't used much so far
- [Foodiesfeed](https://www.foodiesfeed.com/): Free stock food photos (not as extensive as some of the other sites)
- [Public Domain Pictures](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/): Pictures that are free because they're in the public domain
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page): Public domain/CC pictures from the same people that brought you Wikipedia. Useful if you're looking for a picture of something very specific. (Also check out the topic's Wikipedia page.)
